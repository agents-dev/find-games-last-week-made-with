## Source description

The README identifies Arx II as the sequel to Arx: After the Reckoning, built on the Evennia framework, with commands to build the React frontend and start the Evennia server. The repository includes the /game client route, scene and battle pages, player-action and combat UI, WebSocket integration, entry-flow tests and combat smoke tests. The cited combat-actions commit adds player-facing flee, cover, interpose, ready, combo, join and leave actions, telnet combat commands, web dispatch through the shared action seam and end-to-end coverage; it contains exact Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 trailers. Count the current Arx II MUD once. No public live demo was claimed.
