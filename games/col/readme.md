## Source description

The repository contains a real browser arcade, not only an MCTS library: docs/src/components/arcade/games/index.ts currently registers 68 play surfaces and docs/src/components/arcade/games contains a matching game component for each registered definition. treant-wasm/src contains the corresponding Rust game engines, with tests and calibration. GAME-IDEAS.md describes an older 50-visible-plus-17-family-child roadmap count of 67, while the current source index has 68 registered definitions; use the source index as the current count. The live arcade returned HTTP 200. The inspected history contains exact Claude Fable 5 gameplay commits, including the Vanguard, Surakarta, Draughts, World Threes and other game implementations. Count each current registered definition once; this is one repository record containing 68 verified game units.
