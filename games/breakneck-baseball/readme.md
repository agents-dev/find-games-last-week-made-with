## Source description

The README documents a playable Rust/Bevy/Rapier 3D baseball game with native desktop and browser WASM builds, one-player versus CPU and two-player modes, nine-inning or shortened games, five pitches, Magnus-effect ball flight, steals and pickoffs, tag-ups, double plays, dropped third strike, HBP, caught pops, multiple cameras, synthesized audio, team/field themes, substitutions, settings, pause and a live GitHub Pages demo. The source is separated into pure rules, gameplay simulation, presentation and shell/meta layers with dedicated tests; the repository also contains dated playtest screenshots. The inspected gameplay history contains exact Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable trailers on runner, camera, input, audio, fielding and rules work. Count the current baseball game once.
