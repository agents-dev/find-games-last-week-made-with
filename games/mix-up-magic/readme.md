## Source description

The README documents three games that run entirely in the browser: Save the Balloons, a word-guessing hangman game; Mix-Up Magic, a letter-tile unscramble game; and Tap the Critter, a timed whack-a-mole reflex game. The source has separate game components, lobby, theme and difficulty pickers, round results, scores, local leaderboard, persistent player state, synthesized sound, speech, offline operation and Vite build scripts. The cited end-game result commit updates the common gameplay result surface and contains an exact Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 trailer. Count the three independently playable games once each; do not count themes, difficulties or shared UI as games.
