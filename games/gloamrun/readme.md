## Source description

The README documents Gloamrun as a playable endless co-op dungeon crawl with procedural floors, auto-fire nearest-monster combat, movement, dash invulnerability, upgrade drafting, escalating monster waves, bosses, downed-player revival and 2–4 player peer-to-peer rooms. The source includes the game loop, networked game mode, upgrades, shared fixed-step engine, deterministic RNG, host transfer, rematch and storage. The live GitHub Pages demo is linked, and the repository has tests for balance, P2P synchronization, host election, takeover, rematch and room codes. The cited multiplayer/gameplay systems commit contains an exact Co-authored-by: Claude Opus 4.8 trailer. Count the dungeon game once; exclude shared engine modules.
